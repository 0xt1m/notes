### Naming Conventions {#naming-conventions}
*Help understand what each knowledge object does.*
**6 segments of keys:**
1. Group
2. Type
3. Platform
4. category
5. Time
6. Description

**Example:**
*Security-Focused Workflow Action* for *Operations team* that returns *information about user's IP*: 
```
OPS_WFA_Network_Security_na_IPwhoisAction

OPS           = Group
WFA           = Type
Network       = Platform
Security      = Category
na            = Time (not time based in this case)
IPwhoisAction = Description
```

---

### Permissions {#permissions}
Private
: When `user` creates and object it is automatically set to private. It is only available to that  user.

Specific App
: `power user`, `admin` are allowed to create knowledge objects that will be shared will all users of an app.
: Can grant roles read and write permissions.

All Apps
: `admin` is the only user role that is allowed to make knowledge objects available to all apps.
: Can grant roles read and write permissions.

---

## Using Fields {#using-fields}
Selected Fields
: Fields of the utmost importance to you.

Interesting Fields
: Have value in at of 20% of the events.

`Î±` by a field name says the it's a string value.
`#` by a field name says that it's a numerical value.

---

### Field Operators {#field-operators}
*String and Numerical:*
- `=`, `!=`

*Only Numerical:*
- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

**`!=` vs `NOT`**
```
(index=web OR index=security) status!=200
# Returns fields where status code is not equal 200
```
```
(index=web OR index=security) NOT status=200
# Returns all fields that do not have field status which equals 200
```

**`IN`**
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505") === index=web (status=500 OR status=503 OR status=505)
```

---

### `| fields` {#fields-command}
Used to include or exclude fields from your search.
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505")
| fields +status
| stats count by status
```
`| fields` in this case makes the search more efficient 

Use `+` or `-` before a field name to include or exclude a field (default is `+`).
Filtering fields as early as possible is the best practice.

---

### `| rename` {#rename-command}
Used to rename field in your search.
You can give more meaningful or user friendly names to your fields.
==Once you've used rename command the original field name would no longer be available==
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505")
| fields status
| stats count by status
| rename status as "HTTP Status", count as "Number of Events"
```

---

### Index vs Search Time {#index-vs-searchtime}
**Index**
When Splunk ingests data into the index a select number of fields are automaticaly extracted. 
These include `host`, `soucetype`, `source`.
Internal fields: `_time`, `_raw`.

**Search Time**
Splunk will automatically extract fields from your data.

---

### `| eval` {#eval-command}
```
index=network sourcetype=cisco_wsa_squid
| stats sum(sc_bytes) as Bytes by usage
| eval bandwidth = Bytes/1024/1024

# Here, eval takes Bytes field and divides it by 1024 twice.
# Field bandwidth will be created
# bandwidth will have megabytes based on bytes.
```

---

### Field Extraction {#field-extraction}
#### `| erex`
Automatic field extractor. We give it a sample of values and Splunk will try to extract what we want.
```
index=games soucetype=SimCubeBeta
| erex Character from field=_raw examples="pixie, Kooby"
```
We can see the regular expression Splunk uses by clicking on the job menu.

#### `| rex`
We can use regular expressions named captured groups to extract values at search time.
It can be used on field values or raw data.
Rex allows you to match multiple groups.
```
index=games sourcetype=SimCubeBeta
| rex field=_raw "^[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}$"

# Default for field argument is "_raw"
```

---

### Enriching Data With Knowledge Objects {#enriching-data-ko}
#### Calculated Fields
We can create a calculated field for example with bytes to convert it to megabytes and it will convert bytes to megabytes every time it finds bytes.
Make sure the field was extracted before you try to use it.

#### Field Aliases
If you have two different fields that return the same values, you can create aliases to make them look as one field.
Field aliases ==do not== replace or remove the original field names so we can search our data using either the original field name or the alias.

#### Lookups 
Allow you to add other fields and values to your events that are not a part of your index data. 

#### Order of Operations
Field Extractions :arrow_right: Field Aliases :arrow_right: Calculated Fields :arrow_right: Lookups :arrow_right: Event Types :arrow_right: Tags

## Scheduling Reports & Alerts {#reports-alerts}
### Reports {#reports}
It is basically a search string that runs on a scheduled intervals.

Runs on a scheduled interval. Every time a scheduled report is run it can automatically send an email or trigger different actions.
It can also be used to power dashboard panel.

Running concurrent reports, and the search behind them, can put a big demand on your system hardware, even if everything is configured to the recommended specs.

Splunk allow us to set **Schedule Priority**.
We can set a set **Schedule Window** when they may run.

**Schedule Priority** is only accessible to admin users.

**Priority levels:**
1. Default
2. Higher
3. Highest

Include a **Schedule Window** only if the report doesn't have to start at a specific time and you are okay with they delay.

| Action                                | Description                                           |
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Log Event                             | Send log event to Splunk receiver end point           |
| Output results to lookup              | Output the results of the search to a CSV lookup file |
| Output results to telemetry endpoint  | Custom action to output results to telemetry endpoint |
| Run a script                          | Invoke a custom script                                |
| Send email                            | Send an email notification to specified recipients    |
| Webhook                               | Generic `HTTP POST` to a specified URL                |

#### Managing Reports
We can edit: Search string, permissions, schedule, acceleration, summery indexing.
We can also disable, clone, embed, move, or delete a report.

- Users with the `power` role are able to display the report for themselves or to the other users of the app.
- Users with the `admin` role are able to display the report in all apps.

Embeding
: Getting html code to display a report on a web page.

Once embeding is enabled, we will no longer be able to edit attributes for the report.

We can add scheduled report to a dashboard.

---

### Alerts {#alerts}
- Based on searches that run on scheduled intervals or in real-time.
- Notify you when the results of a search meet defined conditions.
- Triggered when search is completed.

**Actions:**
1. Add to triggered alerts
    - We can set the severity of the alert
2. Log events
    - Sent to your splunk deployment for indexing.
3. Output to lookup
    - Create or update a csv lookup table.
4. Send to a telemetry endpoint
5. Run a script
    - Runs a file on your system (deprecated)
6. Send email
    - We can use splunk tokens to add dynamic data to emails.
7. Use a webhook
    - Custom callbacks. Allows to make an alert message pop up in a chat room.
8. Run a custom alert

Admin users can find prebuilt alert actions by clicking on **manage alert actions** link.

When an alert set to **private** only you (owner) can access (edit, view) it.
When an alert set to **Shared in App** the results will be displayed to all users of the app.

By default everyone has read access and `power user` has write access to the alert.

**Scheduled Alert Type** allows you to set a schedule and time range for the search to be run.
We can use `cron`.

**Read-Time Alert Type** will run the search continuously in the background.
As soon as search conditions are satisfied, an action is triggered.
Real-Time Alerts may impact your system performance.

**We can trigger an alert**
- per-result
- number of results
- number of hosts
- number of sources
- custom (spl)

We can use `Throttle` setting to suppress a few actions into one alert (like email), based on field values or time intervals.

#### Managing Alerts
**We can** edit alert, edit permissions, disable, clone, or delete an alert.
Alerts are **private** by default.
