## Knowledge Objects {#knowledge-objects}
*Help you to discover and analyze your data.*

| Name | Functions |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Fields | Building blocks of the splunk search |
| Field extractions | You can extract fields from raw data using regex or delimiters |
| Field aliases | You can give alternate names to some fields to make your search more comfortable. |
| Calculated Fields | Perform calculations based on the values of exsiting fields. |
| Lookups | Additional fields can be added to your data using lookups. |
| Event types | 1. You can save your search as an Event Type.<br>2.Provide a way to help you categorize your data. |
| Tags | Save key:value pairs. Labels for data. |
| Workflow Actions | 1. Provide links within events that interact with external resources or narrow our search. <br>2. Use `GET` or `POST` method to pass information or pass information back to Splunk to permorm a secondary search. |
| Reports | You can save searches that you run repeatedly to reports. |
| Alerts | Get a notification when certain conditions are met. |
| Macros | Frequently used searches saved to kind of functions where you can also pass arguments. |
| Data Models | 1.Hierarchically structured datasets that can consist of three types of datasets. Events. Searches. `AND`, `OR` transactions.<br>2. Explore data in a graphical interface. |

### Naming Conventions {#naming-conventions}
*Help understand what each knowledge object does.*
**6 segments of keys:**
1. Group
2. Type
3. Platform
4. category
5. Time
6. Description

**Example:**
*Security-Focused Workflow Action* for *Operations team* that returns *information about user's IP*: 
```
OPS_WFA_Network_Security_na_IPwhoisAction

OPS           = Group
WFA           = Type
Network       = Platform
Security      = Category
na            = Time (not time based in this case)
IPwhoisAction = Description
```

---

### Permissions {#permissions}
Private
: When `user` creates and object it is automatically set to private. It is only available to that  user.

Specific App
: `power user`, `admin` are allowed to create knowledge objects that will be shared will all users of an app.
: Can grant roles read and write permissions.

All Apps
: `admin` is the only user role that is allowed to make knowledge objects available to all apps.
: Can grant roles read and write permissions.

---

## Using Fields {#using-fields}
Selected Fields
: Fields of the utmost importance to you.

Interesting Fields
: Have value in at of 20% of the events.

`Î±` by a field name says the it's a string value.
`#` by a field name says that it's a numerical value.

---

### Field Operators {#field-operators}
*String and Numerical:*
- `=`, `!=`

*Only Numerical:*
- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

**`!=` vs `NOT`**
```
(index=web OR index=security) status!=200
# Returns fields where status code is not equal 200
```
```
(index=web OR index=security) NOT status=200
# Returns all fields that do not have field status which equals 200
```

**`IN`**
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505") === index=web (status=500 OR status=503 OR status=505)
```

---

### `| fields` {#fields-command}
Used to include or exclude fields from your search.
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505")
| fields +status
| stats count by status
```
`| fields` in this case makes the search more efficient 

Use `+` or `-` before a field name to include or exclude a field (defualt is `+`).
Filtering fields as early as possible is the best practice.

---

### `| rename` {#rename-command}
Used to rename field in your search.
You can give more meaningful or userfriendly names to your fields.
==Once you've used rename command the original field name would no longer be avaliable==
```
index=web status IN ("500", "503", "505")
| fields status
| stats count by status
| rename status as "HTTP Status", count as "Number of Events"
```

---

### Index vs Search Time {#index-vs-searchtime}
**Index**
When Splunk ingests data into the index a select number of fields are automaticaly extracted. 
These include `host`, `soucetype`, `source`.
Internal fields: `_time`, `_raw`.

**Search Time**
Splunk will automatically extract fields from your data.

---

### `| eval` {#eval-command}
```
index=network sourcetype=cisco_wsa_squid
| stats sum(sc_bytes) as Bytes by usage
| eval bandwidth = Bytes/1024/1024

# Here, eval takes Bytes field and divides it by 1024 twice.
# Field bandwidth will be created
# bandwidth will have megabytes based on bytes.
```

---

### Field Extraction {#field-extraction}
#### `| erex`
Automatic field extractor. We give it a sample of values and Splunk will try to extract what we want.
```
index=games soucetype=SimCubeBeta
| erex Character from field=_raw examples="pixie, Kooby"
```
We can see the regular expression Splunk uses by clicking on the job menu.

#### `| rex`
We can use regular expressions named captured groups to extract values at search time.
It can be used on field values or raw data.
Rex allows you to match multiple groups.
```
index=games sourcetype=SimCubeBeta
| rex field=_raw "^[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}$"

# Default for field argument is "_raw"
```

---

### Enriching Data With Knowledge Objects {#enriching-data-ko}
#### Calculated Fields
We can create a calculated field for example with bytes to convert it to megabytes and it will convert bytes to megabytes every time it finds bytes.
Make sure the field was extracted before you try to use it.

#### Field Aliases
If you have two different fields that return the same values, you can create aliases to make them look as one field.
Field aliases ==do not== replace or remove the original field names so we can search our data using either the original field name or the alias.

#### Lookups 
Allow you to add other fields and values to your events that are not a part of your index data. 

#### Order of Operations
Field Extractions :arrow_right: Field Aliases :arrow_right: Calculated Fields :arrow_right: Lookups :arrow_right: Event Types :arrow_right: Tags
